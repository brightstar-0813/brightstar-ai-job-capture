# AI Jobs Capture (multi-source)

Capture **remote AI** jobs from Dice, JobRight, Built In, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, and public remote feeds (Himalayas, Remotive, Jobicy, Remote OK, We Work Remotely, Jobgether, The Muse, Working Nomads, Jobspresso, SkipTheDrive, Arc, Arbeitnow), plus optional USAJOBS / Adzuna / Google Jobs when API keys are set. Runs **twice daily (5:00 AM and 5:00 PM local time)**, appends/dedupes locally, writes a combined CSV, and Slack-notifies on new jobs.

## What gets saved

Each run overwrites **one** combined CSV with the latest qualifying jobs from all sources:

- `download/jobs_latest.csv` — all sources together (`source` column marks Dice / JobRight / Built In / …)
- `download/store.json` — shared dedupe history

Filter (applied to all sources):

- **Keep:** **US remote only** (Remote / Remote OK / Remote Solely — not hybrid or on-site) and title is an **AI Engineer / AI Developer** family role (`Senior AI Engineer`, `Full Stack AI Engineer`, `GenAI Engineer`, `Agentic AI Engineer`, `LLM Engineer`, `AI Developer`, …). Location must be the United States (or a US state). Exact wording is not required. Posted within the last `RECENT_DAYS` days (default 3).
- **Skip:** jobs outside the US (Canada-only, UK, EMEA, LATAM, worldwide/anywhere unless the posting also says US); generic SWE/ML/scientist titles even if the JD mentions AI; non-eng “AI” titles (sales, recruiting, PM); **hybrid/on-site**; **LinkedIn** apply/redirect links; **expired / no-longer-available** postings; postings **older than `RECENT_DAYS`**. A blank or plain "Remote" location is kept only for Dice, JobRight, and Built In, because those searches are already US-scoped.
- **Skip (already applied):** jobs you've **already applied to** — JobRight via `POST /swan/job/applied/jobs-v3`, and **Dice** via the *My Jobs → Applied* tab (needs a saved Dice login, see below). Applied jobs are skipped during capture and removed from the local store each run.

## How automation is split (recommended)

| Source | How it runs | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Dice** | Windows Task Scheduler | Optional login for applied-job exclusion |
| **JobRight** | Scheduler + saved Playwright login (or Chrome extension) | Needs `npm run jobright:login` |
| **Built In** | Scheduler (Playwright) | Reliable; remote + keyword search |
| **Greenhouse / Lever / Ashby** | Scheduler (public board APIs) | No login; polls curated company boards |
| **Himalayas, Remotive, Jobicy, Remote OK, WWR, Jobgether, Arbeitnow, The Muse, Working Nomads** | Scheduler (public JSON/RSS) | No browser |
| **Jobspresso, SkipTheDrive, Arc.dev** | Scheduler (public listing pages) | No API |
| **USAJOBS / Adzuna / Google Jobs** | Scheduler | Skipped until `USAJOBS_*`, `ADZUNA_*`, or `SERPAPI_KEY` is set |
| **ZipRecruiter** | Scheduler (Playwright) | Often Cloudflare-blocked in headless — may return 0 |
| **Monster** | Scheduler (Playwright) | Often empty/blocked in headless — may return 0 |

### Optional: skip already-applied Dice jobs

Dice capture works logged-out, but to also **exclude jobs you've already applied to on Dice**, save a one-time session:

```bash
npm run dice:login
```

A browser opens — sign in, land on your dashboard, press Enter. The session is saved to `download/dice-auth.json` and reused on every run. When it expires you'll get a Slack alert to re-run `npm run dice:login` (Dice capture keeps working meanwhile, just without applied-job exclusion).

### Why the extension for JobRight?

Autofill buttons only show when you are signed in. The extension opens JobRight in a background tab using **your existing Chrome cookies**, scrapes autofill jobs, and posts them to the local API. No `jobright:login` / Playwright auth file needed.

**Requirements for JobRight auto-capture:**

1. Stay signed in to [jobright.ai](https://jobright.ai) in Chrome  
2. API auto-starts at Windows logon (`npm run schedule:api`) — no manual `npm start`  
3. Load this repo’s `extension/` (unpacked)  
4. Click **Capture JobRight** once to verify

## Fully automatic — daily at 5 AM and 5 PM (Windows)

Install **both** scheduled tasks (capture + API at logon):

```bash
npm run schedule:install
```

| Task | What it does |
|------|----------------|
| `AIJobCapture_5am5pm` | Runs capture daily at **5:00 AM** and **5:00 PM** (local time) |
| `AIJobCapture_API_AtLogon` | Starts `node src/server.js` when you log in (so JobRight extension can ingest) |

You do **not** need to open Cursor or type `npm start` after that — just reboot/login once, stay signed in to JobRight in Chrome, and keep the extension loaded.

Optional checks:

```powershell
Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName AIJobCapture_5am5pm, AIJobCapture_API_AtLogon
Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName AIJobCapture_API_AtLogon
Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName AIJobCapture_5am5pm
```

Individual installs: `npm run schedule:dice` or `npm run schedule:api`.

## Manual run

```bash
npm run capture
```

## Local API + extension

```bash
npm start
```

Then load `extension/` unpacked in Chrome.

## Notes

- Personal job-hunting use; polite delays / page caps.
- After JobRight UI changes, re-run `npm run jobright:login` if autofill jobs stop appearing.
- Re-run `npm run schedule:install` after upgrading so Windows tasks use the new `AIJobCapture_*` names (old `DiceJobCapture_*` tasks are removed).
